Unreleased <wk@gnupg.org>

  New option --version.

  A couple of minor fixes.


2003-08-13 <wk@gnupg.org>

  New option -r, --pasv-range to limit the range for passive ports to
  specific firewall rules.

  Print a warning if the /dev directory does not exists below the
  chroot.  It is required so that a syslogd restart won't harm.
  Ignore the /dev directory in the ftp session.

  Fixed some minor problems.
